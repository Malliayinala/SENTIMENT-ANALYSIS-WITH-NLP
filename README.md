# Task-2 : SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP

## About project:

This project performs Sentiment Analysis on social media text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a machine learning classifier. The goal is to classify user-generated text into positive or negative sentiments. The project demonstrates the complete NLP workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation, using a dataset of labeled sentiments (e.g., from Twitter).

Using text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model, this project classifies the emotional tone behind user opinions expressed in natural language.

## Dataset Details:

Sentiment140 (Twitter dataset)

Description: A collection of 1.6 million labeled tweets with sentiment polarity (0 = negative, 4 = positive).

Includes tweets, tweet IDs, dates, user info, and their sentiments.
